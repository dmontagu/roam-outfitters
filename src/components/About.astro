                    <p>
                        For the past 23 years as a trout guide here in Montana's Gallatin Valley, I've carved out
                        a niche as an outfitter offering a fully customized experience built around your skill level
                        and goals for a well-rounded fly-fishing adventure in the Western Rockies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From spring creeks and tailwaters to freestone rivers and mountain lakes, I build each trip
                        around what you've envisioned or researched, and I always aim to over-deliver with a few
                        fresh ideas along the way. The range of water we can explore is vast, and "Roam" is the
                        word that best captures my style as an angler continually learning and appreciating
                        the diverse fisheries of Montana.

                        At home, I'm fortunate to have the support of my wife, Ally, and our two incredible
                        children, our son Waylon and daughter Letty. Our family is at the heart of my drive for
                        a healthy work-life balance, and I feel lucky to still have genuine passion for
                        connecting guests with Montana's remarkable waters.
